                <h3>Know About Me:</h3>
                <p>
                    My journey started as a curious kid who would open everything and try to learn how it workds. My curiosity first led me to Mechanical Engineering, and later on helped me explore programming world. I was very much interested in understanding how things work and when I started my journey in Mechanical Engineering, I understood that the modern world is completely following computers and programs. Therefore, I started exploring computer programs. I first started working with C, I learnt the programming basics with C and it helped me understand how programming works. After that, I stated learning languages like Python, HTML, CSS, and C++. I spent quite enough time on programming languages, but looking at the amount of time it was consuming, I started working on developmental skills. I started learning Unity and Wordpress. These two programs helped me find my first clients in freelancing world. I started creating websites for my clients and I created websites as follows for my clients.

                    <h3>My Focus on my Future:</h3>
                    I am planning to invest on my time and energy in creating a development platform for robotic innovators and gaming developers. I want to make sure I will be able to create opportunities for all the people with ideas to achieve their dreams. Furthermore, I am working hard to invest on my dreams, I am connecting with same mindset and I am trying to learn from different platforms for as much as I can. I have started working on a vision to create a company that would provide digital services worldwide.

                <p>
                    Right now I am following the free bootcamp that is arranged by a group of talented instructors. I encourage our young talents to follow such courses for the amazing plan they have started and the helpfulness of the course afterwards. Moreover, I shoutout to all the beginners to start visiting websites that would help them improve their coding for free. I highly recommend <a href=https://w3schools.com/>W3Schools.com</a> that is a completely free learning environment for coders and programmers.
